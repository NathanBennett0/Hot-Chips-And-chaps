# Hot Chips and Chaps

## Brief
You are to design and implement a program for a single-player graphical adventure game using only the tools available in the Java standard library, and selected libraries from a whitelist provided in this document. The objective of the game is to explore an imaginary world, collecting objects, solving puzzles, and performing actions to complete the game. This project will bring together all of the techniques you have been taught thus far.

Your final solution must run on a stock installation of Java 17 (e.g. Oracle or OpenJDK). This limits the scope of the project, and gives everyone a level playing field.

Chap’s challenge is a creative clone of the (first level of the) 1989 Atari game Chips Challenge. To learn more about Chip’s Challenge, please read the Wikipedia article, watch a playthrough on youtube, or even try to get hold of the actual game (there are some free browser-based versions, and it is available on Steam). In Chips Challenge, an actor moves through a maze directed by the keystrokes of the user, collects treasures and searches for the exit that leads to the next level.
